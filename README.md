# The Cookie Blog

The Cookie Blog is where, two (nerdy) high-school students, voice their opinions about AI art, 
have fun with it and explain to the readers about what is all the deal going around it. And this 
repository is for hosting the website through GitHub Pages.

The blog is hosted with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.
However, the blog is not entirely the same thing as the theme. Because I added a couple more functionalities to it. 

- You can use the "soundcloudembed.html" and "wavfile.html" includes to embed sound files to your blog.
- You can also add your newsletter link to your blog through "newsletter2.html" file, which will put the Email text field at the end of every post.
- You can also add javicons to your blog.
